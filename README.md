Multimedia application project done for a "Usługi i Aplikacje Multimedialne" class at Wrocław University of Science and Technology, under the supervision of mgr. inż Krzysztof Siwy. 

**Disclaimer:** The application in its current form is a PC-based proof-of-concept. A lot can and will change until the final, mobile release.

## Application launch instructions

**Step 1:** Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can check this by typing `python --version` in the console or command prompt. If you don't have Python, you must first install it from the official python.org website. [(Installation instructions.)](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html) The version currently supported by our application is **Python v3.10.9**. The newer Python v3.11 version is not yet supported by all of the libraries we use.

**Step 2:** Download the contents of the repository. (For example, through the **Code > Download ZIP** button) and extract it to create a separate folder containing, among others, the `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and other repository contents.

**Step 3:** Open the console or command prompt and navigate to the folder you just created, where, among others, the `requirements.txt` file and the `main.py` script are located. You can do this using the `cd [path to folder]` command.

**Step 4 (Optional):** You can create a virtual environment to isolate the installed libraries from other interpreter instances. The process of creating virtual environments is described in the [official Python documentation.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) Remember to activate the environment after installation.

**Step 5:** Install the required libraries using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command. This command will install all the libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

**Step 6:** After installing all the libraries, you can run the script using the `python main.py` command. The script should execute correctly and the application should display in a new window.
